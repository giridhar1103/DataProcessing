### Spatial data: 
Spatial data (geospatial data/geographic information) is data that describes the location, shape, and relationships of features on or near the Earthâ€™s surface.
There are two main types:
> Vector data: Uses points, lines, and polygons to represent features. Eg- A point for a bus stop, A line for a road etc

> Raster data: Uses a grid of cells (pixels), where each cell has a value. Eg- Satellite images,Digital elevation models, Temperature maps
